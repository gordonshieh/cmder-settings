# Cmder Settings

Handy dandy settings for the least painful experience of using the command line on Windows.

Follow the better, more up to date guide [here](https://gist.github.com/gordonshieh94/e007c669ba8b8e2ce23837c934dc0f8c)

Alternatively, you can install the fancy fonts used in the settings by:  
  
`git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git`  
  
```
cd fonts
.\install.ps1
```

Then import `cmder.xml`!
